- [X] Each emoji in the family is randomly selected, based on your implementation of `createRandomEmoji()`
- [X] When run, your program iterates through an endless slideshow of these emoji photos, each with randomized backgrounds and emoji styles
  - [X] There is a pause for three seconds on each image so that a viewer may enjoy the slideshow!
- [ ] (Optional) Additional randomly-selected background scenery
- [ ] (Optional) A dark transition between each slide of the slideshow
- [ ] (Optional) Child and adult emojis are shown in a random order
- [ ] (Optional) Modify the background to include multiple times of day in the random scenery

## Reflection

Briefly reflect in writing on your experience solving this exercise. Just a
sentence or two in response to each question is plenty.

**What did you miss? What did you wish you did better?**
I again missed the optional activities. I'm still figuring out my time management for the semester, but given that I do intend on being a computer science major I do want to find a way to engage with the extra stuff.

**What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?**
Documentation was a big help in this activity, especially for the latter parts. When I faced difficulties with the GraphicsGroup class or other kinds of errors based on my lack of knowledge of the packages I was working with, it was always helpful to reference that documentation page.

**What is something that was interesting or exciting, or a lesson you learned
  from this experience that you want to remember?**
I learned how useful helper functions are. The percentChance, randomDouble, and randomInt, for example, were good to have but not necessarily intuitive to include.
